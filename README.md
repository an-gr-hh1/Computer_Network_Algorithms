Network Protocol Algorithms Using C Language

These include Network communication technique algorithms used to transmit data between two linked devices.
It employs socket programming to communicate between client and server.
A socket is a communication endpoint in a computer network that allows two computers to communicate with each other. It is a software construct that allows a computer to send and receive data over the network.
Includes,
1) TCP Protocol
Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is a connection-oriented protocol for communications that helps in the exchange of messages between different devices over a network.

2) UDP Protocol
User Datagram Protocol (UDP) is one of the core protocols of the Internet Protocol (IP) suite. It is a connectionless communication protocol used across the internet for time-sensitive transmissions such as video playback or DNS lookups.

3) Sliding Window Protocol
The sliding window is a technique for sending multiple frames at a time. It controls the data packets between the two devices where reliable and gradual delivery of data frames is needed.
  a) Stop & Wait ARQ
  b) Go-Back-N ARQ
  c) Selective Repeat ARQ

4) File Transfer Protocol:
File Transfer Protocol(FTP) is an application layer protocol that moves files between local and remote file systems.

5) Distance Vector Routing Algorithm:
Distance Vector Routing (DVR) Protocol is a method used by routers to find the best path for data to travel across a network. Each router keeps a table that shows the shortest distance to every other router, based on the number of hops needed to reach them.

6) Leaky Bucket Congestion Control:
Leaky Bucket is a traffic shaping mechanism to control the amount and the rate of traffic sent to the network. The approach of congestion management is called Traffic shaping. Traffic shaping helps to regulate the rate of data transmission and reduces congestion.
